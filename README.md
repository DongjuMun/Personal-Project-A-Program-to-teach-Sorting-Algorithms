Simulation of sorting algorithms (Select, Bubble, Insert, Merge, and Quick.)
A sorting algorithm is a set of instructions that takes an array or list as input and sorts the elements in a specific order. Sortings are usually numerical or alphabetical (or dictionary) and can be ascending (az, 0-9). Those algorithms are essential for those studying Computer Science and this simulation is for the students who are struggling to understand these algorithms.
